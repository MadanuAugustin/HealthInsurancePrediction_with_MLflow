## Health Insurance Prediction Project_with_MLflow

This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict health insurance coverage for individuals. Predicting health insurance needs is crucial for optimizing healthcare resource allocation, planning interventions, and ensuring effective coverage for diverse populations. By employing machine learning algorithms, this project aims to predict health insurance coverage accurately based on relevant features such as medical history, demographics, and lifestyle factors.

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop reliable prediction models that accurately forecast health insurance coverage. These models will assist healthcare providers, policymakers, and insurance companies in understanding and meeting the healthcare needs of populations more effectively.

### Dataset:
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing relevant attributes such as medical conditions, lifestyle habits, demographic information, and previous insurance status. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

### Techniques:
Machine learning algorithms and techniques explored in this project include:
- RandomForestRegressor

### Evaluation:
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error and r2-score. Techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are employed to enhance the models' reliability and applicability across different demographic groups.
